          Experiential Learning Activity ‚Äì Linear Integrated Circuits
 Topic : Filters, Op-Amp linear Circuits, DAC, Application ICs

I'm excited to announce the successful completion of an Open Book Exam conducted for fourth-semester students, ECE, NIE Mysore as part of our Active Learning methodology under the subject Linear Integrated Circuits.
üîç Exam Highlights:
Six distinct sets of questions were prepared, each set containing 6 questions designed at Bloom‚Äôs Levels L2, L3, and L4.
Topics covered: Filters, Op-Amp Circuits, Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), and Application-specific ICs.
üë• Team-Based Learning:
Students were grouped into six teams, each given 90 minutes to collaboratively analyze and solve their question set.
The open book format encouraged critical thinking, peer learning, and concept application.
üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Exploration:
Several teams used circuit simulators to verify design-based questions, demonstrating initiative in validating their understanding through practical tools.
This engaging approach not only deepened their conceptual understanding but also enhanced teamwork, problem-solving, and application skills‚Äîhallmarks of experiential learning.

Big thanks to my students for attending the open book exam. 
I would like to thank Datta kumar Sir and NIE- TLC for the encouragement, motivation and criticism to improvise our teaching. This is an activity under NIE- TLC - Teaching and Learning Center organized by Deccterous NIE- IC Design Club.
