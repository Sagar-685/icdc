          description=" DECCTEROUS IC Design Club Triumphs at IEEE DSCEâ€™s 24-Hour Circuit-A-Thon!

Two teams from the DECCTEROUS IC Design Club recently participated in the National Level 24-Hour Circuit-A-Thon organized by the IEEE DSCE Student Branch, held on 23rd and 24th November at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. The event attracted 106 participants and was divided into three specialized domains:

Embedded Systems â€“ bringing ideas to life with platforms like Arduino and ESP32.
Digital VLSI â€“ transitioning from design to FPGA.
Analog Design â€“ from MOS fundamentals to GDSII.
Our club members shone brightly in the Analog Design category with two remarkable projects:

Third Prize (Analog Circuit Design): Sudeep Kumar, Varshini H R, Sanjay H, and PrekshaDeep from fifth Semester ECE secured third place with their innovative Memristor Emulator Circuit Design for Neuromorphic Computing which is their minor project. Their work impressed the judges and earned them third prize in Analog Domain.

Appreciation for Excellence: Harshitha B H, Satyadutt M S, and Neha M N representing the third semester ECE students, presented their project on the CMOS Low Dropout Voltage Regulator. Their dedication and hard work earned them special appreciation from the jury panel.

Both projects were guided by Dr. Remya Jayachandran, (Senior IEEE Member), NISB CAS Faculty Advisor and Assistant Professor in ECE at NIE Mysore. A huge congratulations to our talented students for their innovative contributions and for representing DECCTEROUS IC Design Club with excellence at such a prestigious event!
